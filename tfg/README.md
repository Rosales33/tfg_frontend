# Telemedicine Frontend â€“ React + Vite

This is the frontend of the Telemedicine platform, built with React and Vite for a fast and lightweight development experience. The project uses Material UI for the interface, React Router for page navigation, and Axios for HTTP communication with the backend.

## Running the project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (if applicable)
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```
2. Navigate to the frontend directory
```bash
cd tfg
```
Replace tfg with the name of your actual frontend folder if different.

3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
This installs all required packages, including:

-@mui/material

-@mui/icons-material

-@mui/lab

-@emotion/react

-@emotion/styled

-react-router-dom

-axios

4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your React app should now be accessible at:
```bash
http://localhost:5173
```
Vite will also show the exact URL in the terminal.
